# Grid-Green
🌿 Powering the Future Sustainably — GreenHack 2025 by ČEPS, Prague, Czech Republic

Designing energy infrastructure that coexists with nature. This project explores sustainable power grid expansion using remote sensing, GIS, and AI. We assess environmental impacts, identify eco-friendly transmission corridors, and model long-term solutions using open datasets like Copernicus, CORINE Land Cover, ÚSES, and ZABAGED.

🔧 Tools: Dash • Python • Plotly • Satellite Data • Machine Learning \n
📡 Data Sources: Sentinel-2, CORINE, ZABAGED, ÚSES, ČEPS Datasets
🌍 Goal: 50-year resilience of green infrastructure in harmony with ecosystems
